<h4>Trauma and the Radiation Exposure Algorithm</h4>
<ul>
<li>Trauma + radiation exposure = combined injury
   <ul>
   <li>Prognosis is worse than the same traumatic injury or exposure alone.
   </ul>
<li>When prioritizing delivery of scarce resources in <b>radiation mass casualty emergencies</b>, it is appropriate to consider prognosis related to 
   <ul>
   <li>Extent of trauma
   <li>Extent of external whole body radiation exposure and significant exposure from any 
   internal contamination, e.g., Polonium-210
   <li>Percent body surface area and depth (i.e., degree) of burns
   <li>Pre-existing medical conditions
   </ul>
<li>Implementation of "Crisis Standards of Care" may be needed in disaster situations.
   <ul>
   <li>The Institute of Medicine has provided extensive guidance.
   <li>Resource limitations may be severe initially, but will improve over time.
   </ul>
<li>Suggested treatment sequence for victims of trauma with exposure
   <ul>
   <li>Treat life- or limb-threatening injuries first.
   <li>Assess for exposure and the Acute Radiation Syndrome (ARS) and consider early (pre-operative) use of white cell cytokines
   <li>Consider Timing of Surgery 
   </ul>
<li>This algorithm and supporting material provide guidelines, not mandates.
<li>See REMM Radioactive Shrapnel for guidance on management.
