<h4>Perform Lifesaving Tasks before Managing Radiation Problems</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Guidance for managing persons </strong><strong>contaminated       with radioactive material</strong> </li>
  <ul >
    <li><strong>General guidance</strong> </li>
    <ul >
      <li>Minimally contaminated         victims do not pose a health risk to rescuers or healthcare providers. </li>
      <li>Perform life- and         limb-saving tasks before managing external or internal radiation         contamination. </li>
      <li>Do not delay life-saving         rescue or transport of a seriously injured or contaminated person. </li>
      <li>This represents the most         likely scenario for most radiological events. </li>
    </ul>
    <li><strong>Modified guidance</strong> for events where highly        radioactive fragments or shrapnel (e.g., Cobalt-60 or Iridium-192) could be embedded in        victims. </li>
    <ul >
      <li>Detection of such fragments         in an injured patient mandates an evaluation be performed by BOTH </li>
      <ul >
        <li>A healthcare provider who          will assess medical status AND </li>
        <li>A radiation safety          professional who will perform a detailed radiation survey of the patient </li>
      </ul>
      <li>If a patient is found to         have embedded, highly radioactive fragment/shrapnel, radiation dose to         healthcare providers must be monitored closely and minimized for those         who may be in <strong>prolonged</strong>, close contact with victims (e.g., CPR         teams, surgeons, operating room staff) by </li>
      <ul >
        <li>Using personal          dosimeters          and/or dose rate          meters to          track radiation dose in real time </li>
        <li>Rotating staff to decrease          total exposure time and minimize risk of exceeding protective          action guides. </li>
        <li>Securing and shielding any          debrided radioactive shrapnel </li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <li>Smith, et al., provide        excellent guidance for medical responses to explosive        RDD events. They        recommend that radiation safety professionals be engaged routinely to        protect all staff along the entire medical response continuum. </li>
    <ul >
      <li>On-scene </li>
      <li>During transport </li>
      <li>In medical facilities </li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <li><strong>Guidance for responders in       areas with widespread, high radiation levels in the environment</strong>, </li>
  <ul >
    <li>Widespread, high radiation        levels in the environment (e.g., after IND detonation) may </li>
    <ul >
      <li>Preclude any rescue actions         in some areas </li>
      <li>Limit work time in other         areas, at least initially </li>
    </ul>
    <li>Radiation safety personnel        and incident managers will supervise response personnel entering and        leaving high risk areas to minimize potential health risks from radiation        exposure. </li>
    <ul >
      <li>Protective         actions and protective         action guidelines         will be implemented reflecting the specifics of the incident. </li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
</ul>
