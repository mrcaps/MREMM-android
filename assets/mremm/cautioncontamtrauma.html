<h4>Trauma and the Radiation Contamination Algorithm</h4>
<ul>
<li>Trauma +  radiation exposure = combined injury 
   <ul>
   <li>Prognosis is worse than the same traumatic injury or exposure alone.
   </ul>
<li>Trauma +  radiation contamination
   <ul>
   <li>External contamination
      <ul>
      <li>By itself, will not usually worsen trauma-related prognosis
      <li>Performing emergency life- and limb-saving tasks/surgery before completing formal external decontamination is appropriate. 
      <li>Removing all clothes can eliminate about 75-90% of external contamination when there is not time to conduct formal decontamination. 
      <li>See Timing of Surgery for details.  
      </ul>
   <li>Internal contamination
      <ul>
      <li>Some trauma victims may need life- and limb-saving surgery before the level of internal contamination is known.
      <li>Bioassays to quantify radiation internal contamination are time consuming and not widely available.
      <li>See Radioactive Shrapnel for management guidance.
      </ul>
   </ul>
<li>When prioritizing delivery of scarce resources in <b>radiation mass casualty emergencies</b>, it is appropriate to consider prognosis related to 
   <ul>
   <li>Extent of trauma
   <li>Extent of external whole body radiation exposure and significant   exposure from any internal contamination, e.g., Polonium-210
   <li>Percent body surface area and depth (i.e., degree) of burns
   <li>Pre-existing medical conditions
   </ul>
<li>Implementation of "Crisis Standards of Care" may be needed in disaster situations.
   <ul>
   <li>The Institute of Medicine has provided extensive guidance.
   <li>Resource limitations may be severe initially, but will improve over time.
   </ul>
<li>This algorithm and supporting material provide guidelines, not mandates.
<li>See REMM Radiation + Trauma page for details.
<li>See REMM Mass Casualty page for details.
