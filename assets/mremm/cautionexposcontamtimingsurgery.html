<h4>Timing of Surgery and the Radiation Exposure + Contamination Algorithm</h4>
<ul>
<li>Radiation exposure + trauma requiring emergency surgery
   <ul>
   <li>Attempt to take surgical emergencies to the operating room
      <ul>
      <li>Within 36-48 hours after high-dose radiation exposure
      <li>Before decline of white blood cell and platelet counts 
      </ul>
   <li>Pre-operative administration of white cell cytokines may extend the time window for surgery.
   </ul>
<li>External contamination + trauma requiring emergency surgery
   <ul>
   <li>Formal external decontamination is appropriate.
   <li>When clinical urgency does not permit formal decontamination 
      <ul>
      <li>Removal of contaminated clothing can eliminate about 75-90% of external contamination.
      <li>Traditional surgical skin prep will also help eliminate skin contamination.
      <li>Avoid pre-op shaving, if possible, to help maintain an intact skin barrier against radioactive materials. 
      </ul>
   </ul>
<li>Activate hospital emergency radiation response plans
   <ul>
   <li>If contaminated patients are admitted to the hospital
   <li>To ensure the health and safety of hospital staff and healthcare team
   <li>To manage/minimize potential contamination of hospital spaces, including operating and radiology suites
   </ul>
<li>This algorithm and supporting material provide guidelines, not mandates.
<li>See REMM Radiation Effects on Blood Counts for details.
   
</ul>
