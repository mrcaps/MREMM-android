<h4>Trauma and the Radiation Exposure + Contamination Algorithm</h4>
<ul>
<li>Trauma + radiation exposure =  combined injury
   <ul>
   <li>Prognosis is worse than the same traumatic injury or exposure alone.
   </ul>
<li>Trauma +  radiation contamination
   <ul>
   <li>External contamination
      <ul>
      <li>By itself, will not usually worsen trauma-related prognosis
      <li>Performing emergency life- and limb-saving tasks/surgery before completing formal external decontamination is appropriate.
      <li>Removal of contaminated clothing can eliminate about 75-90% of external contamination when there is not time to complete formal decontamination.
      <li>See Timing of Surgery for details.  
      </ul>
   <li>Internal contamination
      <ul>
      <li>Some trauma victims may need life- and limb-saving surgery before the level of internal contamination is known.
      <li>Bioassays to quantify internal contamination are time consuming and not widely available.
      <li>See REMM Radioactive Shrapnel for management guidance
      </ul>
   </ul>
<li>When prioritizing delivery of scarce resources in <b>radiation mass casualty emergencies</b>, it is appropriate to consider prognosis related to
   <ul>
   <li>Extent of trauma
   <li>Extent of external whole radiation exposure and significant exposure from any internal contamination, e.g., Polonium-210
   <li>Percent body surface area and depth (i.e., degree) of burns
   <li>Pre-existing medical conditions
   </ul>
<li>Implementation of &quot;Crisis Standards of Care&quot; may be needed in disaster situations.
   <ul>
   <li>The Institute of Medicine has provided extensive guidance.
   <li>Resource limitations may be severe initially, but will improve over time.
   </ul>
<li>Suggested treatment sequence for victims of trauma with exposure <b>and</b> contamination
   <ul>
   <li>Treat life- or limb-threatening injuries first.
   <li>Consider Timing of Surgery
   <li>Assess for exposure and the Acute Radiation Syndrome (ARS) and consider early (pre-operative) use of white cell cytokines
   <li>Perform external decontamination as soon as possible, but do not delay life- or limb-saving emergency surgery.
   <li>Assess for internal contamination and determine need for treatment.
   </ul>
<li>This algorithm and supporting material provide guidelines, not mandates.
