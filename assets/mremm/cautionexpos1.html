<h4> <font color="#FF0000"> <strong> Cautionary Notes 1 for Exposure Algorithm
in Mass Casualty Events </strong></font></h4>
<ul>
<li>The REMM Exposure Algorithm is appropriate for events small enough to permit individualized evaluation and treatment of each patient/victim. </li>
<li>Limited resource availability in mass casualty events (e.g., personnel, equipment, medical facilities, laboratories) may necessitate major modification of the Exposure Algorithm.</li>
<li>Large numbers of acutely ill victims may overwhelm the available medical infrastructure, at least initially. </li>
<li>Some victims at or near the epicenter may be inaccessible due to radiation levels that would significantly endanger rescue workers.</li>
<li>Initial logistical barriers and damage to local medical infrastructure will prevent timely collection, transport, analysis, and reporting results of huge numbers of biological specimens normally used to estimate radiation exposure dose, diagnose Acute Radiation Syndrome (ARS) and manage organ dysfunction and trauma. </li>
<li>When laboratory data are unavailable, geographical factors (location of the victim in relation to the epicenter), historical factors (time to onset of nausea/vomiting after radiation exposure), and clinical signs and symptoms will be the primary means available to diagnose ARS. </li>
<li>When laboratory data are unavailable, empiric use of hematopoietic growth factors (after FDA Emergency Use Authorization) may be recommended for victims thought to be at high risk of significant ARS based on the factors noted above. </li>
<li>This algorithm and supporting material provide guidelines, not mandates. </li>
</ul>
