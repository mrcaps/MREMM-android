  <h4><font color="#FF0000"> <strong>Cautionary Notes for Contamination Algorithm 
    in Mass Casualty Events </strong></font></h4>

<ul>

<li>The REMM Contamination Algorithm is appropriate for events small enough to permit individualized evaluation and decontamination of each patient/victim. </li>

<li>Limited resource availability in mass casualty events (e.g., insufficient water, personnel, equipment, medical facilities, laboratories) may necessitate major modifications of Contamination Algorithm guidelines.</li>

<li>Large numbers of victims seeking decontamination and reassurance may overwhelm the emergency response infrastructure, at least initially. </li>

<li><b>Modifications to both the Contamination Algorithm and Decontamination Procedures Guidelines in a mass casualty event may include </b></li>

   <ul>

   <li>Instructing large numbers of ambulatory victims to  self-decontaminate at home</li>

   <li>Limiting radiation surveys to simplified, one-time screenings of the head, neck, hands, and forearms rather than comprehensive whole body screenings with repeated re-evaluations </li>

   <li>Altering decontamination methods </li>

   <li>Altering target decontamination levels (i.e., accepting decontamination levels in excess of 2 times background) </li>

   <li>Eliminating or curtailing early collection of biological specimens (e.g. radioisotope assays, nasal swabs) if logistical barriers to timely collection, transport, analysis, and reporting results limit their utility </li>

   <li>Initiating isotope decorporation therapy in highly selected, life-threatening circumstances prior to receiving diagnostic test results normally required </li>

   </ul>

<li>This algorithm and supporting material are guidelines, not mandates. </li>

</ul>
