<h4>Mass Casualty Emergencies and Radiation Exposure Algorithm</h4>
<ul>
<li>The REMM Exposure Algorithm
   <ul>
   <li>Is appropriate for events small enough to permit individualized victim evaluation and treatment 
   </ul>
<li>Algorithm modifications may be needed for <b>radiation mass casualty emergencies</b> because of 
   <ul>
   <li>Limited numbers of medical staff, hospital personnel
   <li>Shortages of equipment and resources
   <li>Physical damage to healthcare facilities including medical laboratories
   <li>Overwhelming numbers of victims presenting for care, some acutely ill
   </ul>
<li>Exposure algorithm modifications during <b>radiation mass casualty emergencies</b>
   <ul>
   <li>Diagnosing exposure and the Acute Radiation Syndrome (ARS) usually requires clinical laboratory support. 
      <ul>
      <li>See Dose Estimator for Exposure
      </ul>
   <li>Without sufficient lab capacity, clinicians may need to estimate dose and ARS severity, initiate triage, and begin treatment by
      <ul>
      <li>Matching the reported location of a victim to estimated radiation levels in the environment at that location
      <li>Using clinical signs and symptoms to diagnose ARS
         <ul>
         <li>Time to onset of nausea/vomiting after radiation exposure
         <li>Signs and symptoms of ARS 
         </ul>
      </ul>
   <li>Empiric use of white cell cytokines may be advised for some victims, based on clinical estimates of dose and ARS severity.
      <ul>
      <li>FDA Emergency Use Authorization may be needed to access medical countermeasures from the Strategic National Stockpile.
      </ul>
   </ul>
<li>When prioritizing delivery of scarce resources in <b>radiation mass casualty emergencies</b>, it is appropriate to consider prognosis related to 
   <ul>
   <li>Extent of trauma
   <li>Extent of external whole body radiation exposure and significant exposure from any 
   internal contamination, e.g., Polonium-210
   <li>Percent body surface area and depth (i.e., degree) of burns
   <li>Pre-existing medical conditions
   </ul>
<li>Implementation of "Crisis Standards of Care" may be needed in disaster situations.
   <ul>
   <li>The Institute of Medicine has provided extensive guidance.
   <li>Resource limitations may be severe initially, but will improve over time.
   </ul>
<li>This algorithm and supporting material provide guidelines, not mandates.
<li>See REMM Mass Casualty page for details.
<li>See REMM Radiation + Trauma for details.
