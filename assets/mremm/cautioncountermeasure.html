<h4><font color="#FF0000"> <strong> Caution and Comments about Radiation Countermeasures for Treatment  </strong></font></h4>

</font><ul> 
<li><font size="2" face="Arial, Verdana">Only the 3 FDA-approved countermeasures for internal contamination are listed on Mobile REMM. See REMM online for more detailed countermeasure information.
</font></li>
<li><font size="2" face="Arial, Verdana">Caution about clinical issues</font></li>
<ul>
   <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Verdana">Many of the countermeasures listed in the table on REMM online have an unfavorable risk-to-benefit ratio when used to treat persons having low levels of internal contamination. </font></li>
   <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Verdana">Most authorities do not recommend treatment of internal contamination when the body burden is less than one annual limit of intake (ALI). </font></li>
   <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Verdana">Treatment is strongly recommended when the body burden exceeds 10 ALI. </font></li>
   <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Verdana">For internal contamination levels greater than 1 ALI and less than 10 ALI, clinical judgment dictates treatment of internal contamination.</font></li>
   <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Verdana">Except for potassium iodide, DTPA, and Prussian blue, none of the countermeasures listed in REMM are FDA approved for decorporation, even if they have other uses that are FDA approved. If used, all off-label medications must be used with extreme caution. Use of FDA approved medications also requires clinical expertise, and knowledgeable specialists should be consulted when possible.</font></li>
  </ul>
<li><font size="2" face="Arial, Verdana">Comments about conceptual issues</font></li>
   <ul>
   <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Verdana">According to NCRP, ALI is an operational quantity defined originally by ICRP as the level of intake of radionuclide activity that would irradiate a person to the <b>annual</b> limit set by the ICRP for <b>occupational (workplace) exposure</b>. Per NCRP, this number is usually considered to be 0.05 Sv (5 rem) effective dose and 0.5 Sv (50 rem) equivalent dose to any exposed tissue. This equivalent dose is thought to be below the threshold at which deterministic health effects occur and simultaneously low enough to limit the incidence of any stochastic health effects. The ALI concept assumes low level <b>continuous uptake</b>, as could happen with an <b>occupational</b> exposure. The ALI concept was developed to protect <b>workers</b>, not members of the general public. ALI was never intended for use as a measure of intake for persons internally contaminated as a result of radiological or nuclear incidents and certainly not for members of the public during events such as accidents or terrorist incidents, when intake might occur over a very short period of time.Nevertheless, the ALI concept has been used by some clinicians when considering when to initiate countermeasures for individual members of the public who have been internally contaminated with radioactive materials as a result of a terrorist incident or unintentional event (e.g., transportation accident). </font></li>
   <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Verdana">The NCRP is currently developing new formulae to replace the ALI as a management guideline for treatment of internal contamination after non-occupational radiation events. This new guidance will update that in NCRP Report No. 65, <i>Management of Persons Accidentally Contaminated with Radionuclides.</i></font></li>
