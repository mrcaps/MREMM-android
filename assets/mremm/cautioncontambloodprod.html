<h4>Blood Products Use and the Radiation Contamination Algorithm</h4>
<ul>
<li>Patients with certain kinds of internal contamination (e.g., Polonium-210) can be at risk for Acute Radiation Syndrome (ARS)
   <ul>
   <li>Patients with ARS will be immunosuppressed.
   <li>They are at risk for post-transfusion graft versus host disease (GVHD).
   <li>Guidelines suggest that these patients should receive blood products that have been both
      <ul>
      <li>Irradiated and
      <li>Leuko-reduced
      </ul>
   <li>If irradiated, leuko-reduced blood is unavailable, 
      <ul>
      <li>Emergency transfusions may still be considered. 
      <li>Attention should be paid to possible post-transfusion GVHD.
      </ul>
   </ul>
<li>Most patients with external contamination but no known radiation exposure
   <ul>
   <li>Are unlikely to develop ARS
   <li>Should be evaluated for ARS before receiving blood products
   </ul>
<li>This algorithm and supporting material provide guidelines, not mandates.
<li>See REMM Blood Products page for more details.
 
</ul>
