<h4>Mass Casualty Emergencies and Radiation Exposure + Contamination Algorithm</h4>
<ul>
<li>The REMM Exposure + Contamination Algorithm
   <ul>
   <li>Is appropriate for events small enough to permit individualized victim evaluation and treatment
   </ul>
<li>Algorithm modifications may be needed for <b>radiation mass casualty emergencies</b> because of
   <ul>
   <li>Limited numbers of medical staff, hospital personnel
   <li>Shortage of equipment and resources
   <li>Physical damage to healthcare facilities including medical laboratories
   <li>Overwhelming numbers of victims presenting for care, external decontamination, treatment of internal contamination, reassurance
   </ul>   
<li>Exposure + contamination algorithm modifications during <b>radiation mass casualty emergencies</b>
   <ul>
   <li>Exposure
      <ul>
      <li>Diagnosing exposure and the Acute Radiation Syndrome (ARS) usually requires clinical laboratory support. 
            <ul>
            <li>See Dose Estimator for Exposure
            </ul>
      <li>Without sufficient lab capacity, clinicians may need to estimate dose and ARS severity, initiate triage, and begin treatment by
            <ul>
            <li>Matching the reported location of a victim to estimated radiation levels in the environment at that location
            <li>Using clinical signs and symptoms to diagnose ARS
               <ul>
               <li>Time to onset of nausea/vomiting after radiation exposure
               
               <li>Signs and symptoms of ARS
               </ul>
            </ul>
      <li>Empiric use of white cell cytokines may be advised for some victims based on clinical estimates of dose and ARS severity.
            <ul>
            <li>FDA Emergency Use Authorization may be needed to access medical countermeasures from the Strategic National Stockpile.
            </ul>
      </ul>      
   <li>External contamination
      <ul>
      <li>Limiting/altering radiation surveys
            <ul>
            <li>Conducting one-time screenings of head, neck, hands, and forearms
            <li>Avoiding multiple whole body screenings and re-evaluations during initial triage
            </ul>
      <li>Altering targets for decontamination
            <ul>
            <li>Accepting target decontamination levels in excess of 2 times background 
            </ul>
      <li>Directing ambulatory victims away from medical facilities to community reception centers and 
      <li>Providing instructions for self-decontamination at home 
      </ul>
   <li>Internal contamination
      <ul>
      <li>Bioassays to quantify the level of internal contamination are time consuming and not widely available, particularly in <b>radiation mass casualty events</b>.
            <ul>
            <li>Collection of certain biological specimens (e.g. radioisotope bioassays, nasal swabs) may need to be delayed or omitted.
            <li><b>Initial</b> simple screening of large numbers of bioassay specimens may be needed to identify those with the highest levels of internal contamination. 
            <li>Follow-up evaluation will be recommended first for those whose initial results suggest the highest level of contamination.
            </ul>
      <li>Empiric treatment of internal contamination may be advisable in highly selected, life-threatening circumstances, even in the absence of definitive diagnostic test results.
            <ul>
            <li>For large mass casualty events, countermeasures from the 
            Strategic National Stockpile may be needed.
            </ul>
      </ul>
   </ul>            
<li>When prioritizing delivery of scarce resources in radiation mass casualty emergencies, it is appropriate to consider prognosis related to 
   <ul>
   <li>Extent of trauma
   <li>Extent of external whole body radiation exposure and significant exposure from any internal contamination, e.g., Polonium-210
   <li>Percent body surface area and depth (i.e., degree) of burns
   <li>Pre-existing medical conditions
   </ul>
<li>Implementation of &quot;Crisis Standards of Care&quot; may be needed in disaster situations.
   <ul>
   <li>The Institute of Medicine has provided extensive guidance.
   <li>Resource limitations may be severe initially but will improve over time.
   </ul>
<li>Suggested treatment sequence for victims of exposure
<b>and</b> contamination
   <ul>
   <li>Treat life- or limb-threatening injuries first.
   <li>Consider Timing of Surgery .
   <li>Perform external decontamination as soon as possible, but do not delay life- or limb-saving emergency surgery
   <li>Assess for exposure and ARS and consider early use of white cell cytokines
   <li>Assess for internal contamination and determine need for treatment
   </ul>
<li>This algorithm and supporting material are guidelines, not mandates.
