<h4>Mass Casualty Emergencies and Radiation Contamination Algorithm</h4>
<ul>
<li>The REMM Contamination Algorithm
   <ul>
   <li>Is appropriate for events small enough to permit individualized victim evaluation and treatment, including decontamination
   </ul>
<li>Algorithm modifications may be needed for <b>radiation mass casualty emergencies</b> because of 
   <ul>
   <li>Limited numbers of medical staff, hospital personnel
   <li>Shortage of equipment and resources
   <li>Physical damage to healthcare facilities including medical laboratories
   <li>Overwhelming numbers of victims presenting for care, external decontamination, treatment of internal contamination, reassurance
   </ul>
<li>Contamination algorithm modifications during <b>radiation mass casualty emergencies
</b> 
   <ul>
   <li>External contamination
      <ul>
      <li>Limiting/altering radiation surveys
         <ul>
         <li>Conducting one-time screenings of head, neck, hands, and forearms
         <li>Avoiding multiple whole body screenings and re-evaluations during initial triage
         </ul>
      <li>Altering targets for decontamination
         <ul>
         <li>Accepting target decontamination levels in excess of 2 times background 
         </ul>
      <li>Directing ambulatory victims away from medical facilities to community reception centers and 
      <li>Providing instructions for self-decontamination at home 
      </ul>
   <li>Internal contamination
      <ul>
      <li>Bioassays to quantify the level of internal contamination are time consuming and not widely available, <b>particularly in mass casualty events</b>.
         <ul>
         <li>Collection of certain biological specimens (e.g. radioisotope bioassays, nasal swabs) may need to be delayed or omitted.
         <li><b>Initial</b> simple screening of large numbers of bioassay specimens may be needed to identify those with the highest levels of internal contamination. 
         <li>Follow-up evaluation will be recommended first for those whose initial results suggest the highest level of contamination.
         </ul>
      <li>Empiric treatment of internal contamination  may be advisable in highly selected, life-threatening circumstances, even in the absence of definitive diagnostic test results.
         <ul>
         <li>For large mass casualty events, countermeasures from the 
         Strategic National Stockpile may be needed.
         </ul>
      </ul>
   </ul>
<li>When prioritizing delivery of scarce resources in <b>radiation mass casualty emergencies</b>, it is appropriate to consider prognosis related to 
   <ul>
   <li>Extent of trauma
   <li>Extent of external whole body radiation exposure and significant exposure from any internal contamination, e.g., Polonium-210
   <li>Percent body surface area and depth (i.e., degree) of burns
   <li>Pre-existing medical conditions
   </ul>
<li>Implementation of "Crisis Standards of Care" may be needed in disaster situations.
   <ul>
   <li>The Institute of Medicine has provided extensive guidance.
   <li>Resource limitations may be severe initially, but will improve over time.
   </ul>
<li>This algorithm and supporting material are guidelines, not mandates.
<li>See REMM Mass Casualty page for more details.
<li>See REMM Radiation + Trauma for more details.
